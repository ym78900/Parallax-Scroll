# Parallax-Scroll

Ussing Scorll Magic library to make half part of the screen scrollable.
ScrollMagic is a scroll interaction library.


The sources can be found in the following Link:
https://scrollmagic.io/

To get your copy of ScrollMagic you have the choice between four options:

Option 1: GitHub
Download a zip file containing the source code, demo page, all examples and documentation from the GitHub releases page or clone the package to your machine using the git command line interface:

``git clone git://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic.git``

Option 2: Bower
ScrollMagic is also available on bower and will only install the necessary source code, ignoring all example and documentation files.
Please mind that since they are not core dependencies, you will have to add frameworks like GSAP, jQuery or Velocity manually, should you choose to use them.

``bower install scrollmagic``

Option 3: npm
If you prefer the node package manager, feel free to use it.
Keep in mind that like with bower non-crucial files will be ignored (see above).

npm install scrollmagic
Option 4: CDN
If you don't want to host ScrollMagic yourself, you can include it from cdnjs:

``http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ScrollMagic/2.0.7/ScrollMagic.min.js``

All plugins and uncompressed files are also available on cdnjs.
For example:

``
http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ScrollMagic/2.0.7/plugins/debug.addIndicators.js
http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ScrollMagic/2.0.7/plugins/debug.addIndicators.min.js
``
